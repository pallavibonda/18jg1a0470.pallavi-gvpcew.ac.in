Methods of Election in India
Let us first list down the methods of election process that are performed and learn about the merits and demerits that each carry:

-----First Past the Post System
In this method, the elections are held for each constituency fixed by the Election Commission and the candidate who gets the maximum number of votes is declared as a winner.

Merits:

It is a very simple method of election which is very easy to administer
It is an inexpensive method
Considering the fact that still not many citizens are literate in the country, it seems to be a very convenient method for the majority of the people

Demerits:

Since in India, there are multiple parties and some independent candidates too, who compete for the same seat, it is often the case that a majority of the votes are distributed amongst different parties or candidates and finally the one which gets highest amongst them is declared the winner. This may mean that the winning party or candidate may not have won the votes of the majority
In this system, there is a huge possibility that the voices of the minority section is left unheard, thus reducing the very essence of a true democracy
------Proportional Representation System
It is a method in which the seats in the legislature are given in proportion to the amount of votes.

Merits:

It works well for a multi-party system such as in India which would give weightage to each party irrespective of their size and the total number of votes won
The minority voice is not left unheard
It gives ample space to all the parties new or old, big or small
Demerits:

Since it provides a government which is not in majority, it results in a coalition government, which implies that there may be chances of a weak coalition
As stated above regarding the low literacy levels of the majority of the voters in India, this system does not do much justice as it seems like a very complicated system for a simple population
Understanding the complications of the proportional representative system and the very simple nature of the first past the post system, the Law Commission of India recommended the Additional Member System in 1999. It recommended a mix of both the above systems to reap the benefits of both as well get the best possible mixture for an efficient conduct of the electoral process.
